Version:     1.0.0
Synopsis:    Convert file extensions to MIME types
Description: This library contains a database of MIME types that
  maps filename extensions into MIME types suitable for use in many
  Internet protocols such as HTTP or e-mail.  It is generated from
  the [mime.types] file found in Unix systems, but has no dependency
  on a filesystem since it includes the contents of the database as
  an ML datastructure.
